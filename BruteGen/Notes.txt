Transformer:
Neutral network architecture that uses attention mechanisms.

Attention mechanism - Learns dependencies between different elements of a sequence based on position and content.

Idea:
# Differentiate conjunctions (and, if, or etc) and other stuff (nouns/verbs) from each other from any .txt.

Possibly use it as my own micro-LLM

example:

I am a baseball player, and part of the sport is throwing the baseball.
I like apples and oranges, but I dislike bananas.
I am so awesome

conjunctions: I, am, a, and, of, the, so

# hence "training" the ai

plans:
# -manual training (be given questions like "Do you throw a football?" or "Is pizza a noun?" etc)
# -match nouns to verbs that can be applied to them (Throw, football; Shoot, basketball; Shoot, gun)
