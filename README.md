# Brute-Gen
Started work 11/28/2024

Brute Gen is a small project of mine designed to mimick how AI machine learning functions. I wouldn't dare call it an artifical intelligence whatsoever, as this has all been made from the ground up without any prior experience with LLMs.

Keep in mind this was made by a high schooler, bugs and errors might be prevalent.

# How to use:

# # Establishing words and their uses
1. Put in phrases, words, gibberish, basically whatever you want into Insertion.txt
2. Run training.py
3. Answer the questions regarding every unfamiliar word. Just answer "c" for conjugates, "n" for nouns, and so on.

Keep in mind that unanswered questions will just be ignored.
