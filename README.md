# Brute-Gen
Started work 11/28/2024

Brute Gen is a small project of mine designed to mimick how AI machine learning functions. I wouldn't dare call it an artifical intelligence whatsoever, as this has all been made from the ground up without any prior experience with LLMs.

Keep in mind this was made by a high schooler, bugs and errors might be prevalent.
